```

# Methods: Modeling

 **Linear Model:** After classifying all retired players, get proportion of "couldbaeen" retirees and call this `prop`.
 
- As such, we now have $50$ data points (for each year), so we run a linear model fitting `Year ~ prop`.
- Because there will always be "couldabeens", we do not expect a large effect size and hence a very significant result.
- If our research hypothesis is correct (that there is an effect), we expect to see a positive coefficient for $\beta_{Year}$.

# Linear Model: Couldabeens Retirees (Pre-rule Era: 1969-2002)

```{r}
# Partition dataset into years before and after rule
couldabeens_pre <- prerule(couldabeens)
couldabeens_post <- postrule(couldabeens)
```


```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2.75}
# Obtain linear model for pre-rule years
model_pre <- lm(formula = prop ~ I(Year), data = couldabeens_pre)
coefs_pre <- model_pre$coefficients
# Plot proportion of couldabeens in pre-rule era ()
plot_props_linear(couldabeens_pre, coefs_pre, 
                  color = "salmon", title = "Proportion of Couldabeen Retirees")
```

# Linear Model: Couldabeens Retirees (Post-rule Era: 2003-2018)

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2.75}
# Obtain linear model for post-rule years
model_post <- lm(formula = prop ~ I(Year), data = couldabeens_post)
coefs_post <- model_post$coefficients
# Plot proportion of couldabeens in post-rule era ()
plot_props_linear(couldabeens_post, coefs_post, 
                  color = "skyblue2", title = "Proportion of Couldabeen Retirees")
```

# Overall Results: Linear Models

**Post-rule era** 

- Post-rule era model: $\beta_{Year} = 0.002064$. As such, since $\beta_{Year} > 0$. 
- There is evidence that the rule has lead to an increase in the proportion of couldabeens. 

**Pre-rule era** 

- Pre-rule era, we obtained a parameter $\beta_{Year} = 0.005773$.  As such, we also have $\beta_{Year} > 0$. 
- Conclude that up until the rule has been implemented, the proportion of couldabeens has been rising, and it rapidly drops in 2003 (year of the rule) only to increase again.

# Simpson's Paradox

- We chose to partition the dataset into the post-rule and pre-rule eras and fit a linear model `Year ~ prop`.
- In both partitions, we find that the parameter $\beta_{Year} > 0$. 
- However, if we do not make the partition, we find that $\beta_{Year} \approx 0$. 
- This raises some questions regarding the role our partition plays in our inference and modeling choices. 
- In fact, this is *Simpson's Paradox*.

```{r, echo = F}
# Obtain linear model for all years
model_comp <- lm(formula = prop ~ I(Year), data = couldabeens)
coefs_comp <- model_comp$coefficients
```

# Simpson's Paradox

```{r, fig.height = 2.75}
col <- "mediumvioletred"
col1 <- "salmon"
col2 <- "skyblue2"
# Plot proportion of couldabeens in post-rule era ()
scatter_props(couldabeens, title = "Proportion of Couldabeen Retirees") +
    geom_abline(slope = coefs_comp[2], intercept = coefs_comp[1], color = col) + 
    geom_point(data = couldabeens_pre, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = prop), color = col1) +
    geom_abline(slope = coefs_pre[2], intercept = coefs_pre[1], color = col1) +
    geom_point(data = couldabeens_post, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = prop),color = col2) +
    geom_abline(slope = coefs_post[2], intercept = coefs_post[1], color = col2) + 
    labs(y = "Proportion")
```

# Threshold Stability

Recall the definition of the Couldabeen classifier: 

## The General Couldabeen Classifier

Given a threshold $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we construct the corrosponding classifier for "couldabeen" status $C$ of a given retired player $p$ (from the year $Y$) to be as follows:
\[
C(p) = \begin{cases}
True, \,  \text{WAR}_p \geq \mu_Y + t\sigma_Y \\
False, \, \text{WAR}_p < \mu_Y + t\sigma_Y
\end{cases}
\]

# Threshold Stability

- Analyze the effects of the threshold $t$ on the impact of our $\beta_{\text{Year}}$ fitting the linear models. 
- Our inference relies on $\beta_{\text{Year}}$ being positive for any $t \in \R$. 
- Obtained a supporting result for $\beta_{Year}$ for only a particular threshold ($t = 0$) in the post-rule era. 
- Varying the threshold tells another story.
- Run a linear model with `Year ~ prop` against a varying threshold $t \in \mathbb{R}$.
- Found that $\beta_{Year}$ is quite unstable.

# Threshold Stability

```{r, out.width= "80%", fig.cap = "Parameters of the Linear Model against varying threshold for couldabeen status"}
include_graphics("images/coef.jpeg")
```

# Threshold Stability: Possible Adjustments

- Thresholds every year were calculated as a function of *only* that year's data. 
- So, the sample from which we obtain the threshold by each level (corrosponding to each year) is very small meaning small changes to the threshold cause high levels of noise in our final model. 
- To treat this problem, we may consider "smoothing" the threshold out by taking the data of that year and adjacent years. 
For instance, instead of considering just 2018 data, we may take 2017-2019 data for a "window length of 1". 
- Furthermore, the addition of some supplementary yearly salary/budgets data may be useful as another predictor since `Year` alone does not seem to have good explanatory power.
